# 🟦 Base DAO Nouns  

DAO inspired by the **Nouns DAO** protocol, built on the **Base network** using the **Nouns Builder**.  
An experiment in onchain governance, generative art, and decentralized treasury.  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  

- **1 Auction per Day**  
  Every 24h, a new Noun is automatically generated and put up for auction.  
- **Onchain Treasury**  
  All proceeds go directly into the DAO treasury, fully transparent.  
- **Open Governance**  
  Noun holders can create proposals and vote on the decisions that shape the future of the community.  
- **Generative Art**  
  Avatars follow the same format as the Nouns collection:  
  - **Backgrounds**  
  - **Heads**  
  - **Glasses**  
  - **Bodies**  
  - **Accessories**
